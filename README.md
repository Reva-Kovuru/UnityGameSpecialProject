This game is a Special Project submission at Faculty of Science & Technology (FST), IFHE Hyderabad.

Created by two Third year B. Tech Students, this game is our first foray into game development.
<br>

This is our shot at a decent top-down 2D A-RPG game. We combined easy controls with smooth gameplay that rewards and adapts to any type of player irrespective of the skill level.

Here are few screenshots of the game.
